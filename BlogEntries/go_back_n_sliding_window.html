  			<p>
          A very important part of computer networking is reliably getting data packets from one destination to the other with as little delay as possible.  It is not guranteed that
          if we send a packet into the network that it will actually reach its destination, and if it does we cannot guarantee that we will receive any
          acknowledgement that it was received.  This is where reliable data transfer protocols come in, and where the star of this article, Go Back N Sliding Window, can
          be used to carry out reliable communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          So how does it work?  We have a sender who wants to send as many packets as possible without having to wait too long for a reply from the receiver.  The sender
          must receive an acknowledgement for each packet it sends so that it knows whether to retransmit or not, and the receiver needs to receive each packet and know what
          order they should go in.
        </p>

        <p>
         For this protocol we will define a set of sequence numbers that determine what order the packets were sent in.
         The receiver will ignore any packet that it receives out of order and only acccept the next valid sequence number.  The sequence numbers will wrap around, so that
         if we have eight sequence numbers, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, the next expected sequence number after 7 will be 0.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will define a window size N, that will be the number of packets currently awaiting acknowledgement from the receiver.
          The sender will begin sending packets and attaching the next sequence number to them, starting with the first sequence number (0 in our example), and ending on the Nth sequence number.
          In our example the biggest N we can choose is 7, so that all but one of the sequence numbers are in use at one time.  This is important because if all sequence numbers
          were in use at the same time the next sequence number would wrap around to a number already in use, and the receiver could end up getting confused about which packet actually
          comes first.
        </p>


        <p>
          So our sender sends the packets with numbers 0-6, and waits for an acknowledgement from the receiver for each.  If an acknowledgement is received for a packet,
          the 'window' slides over and the next packet is sent.  So if we receive and acknowledgement for packet 0, we then send packet 7, and are now awaiting acknowledgement
          for packets 1-7.  Now, if we miss an acknowledgement, say for packet 1, but we receive acknowledgement for packet 2, we know that packet 1 was received because the
          receiver would not have accepted packet 2 otherwise.  In this case we can move the window up by 2.  We are now awaiting acknowledgement for packets {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1}.
          If we do not receive an acknowledgement after a specified amount of time, we will retransmit every packet currently in the window (in this case {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1}).
        </p>

        <p>
          On the receiver side, three things can happen.  One, we could receive the next packet in order, and everything is fine.  Two, we could receive an out of order packet, in which case
          we drop it and continue waiting.  After some timeout the sender will retransmit the whole window and we will (hopefully) receive the next packet in order.  Third, we could receive
          a retransmition of a packet we have already acknowledged.  In this case, we know the sender has not received the acknowledgement for that packet, and we retransmit it so that the
          sender can move on in the window.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that's it.  We now have a reliable way to send data back and forth between a sender and a receiver.  If no packets are dropped the sender will just keep advancing the window
          and sending packets without stopping, and if a few packets do get dropped, the window will prevent the sender from getting too far ahead of the receiver.  And that is how the Go
          Back N Sliding Window protocol works.
