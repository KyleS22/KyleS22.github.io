# A Bit About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. I like to learn new things, and I try to challenge myself through the projects I choose to create. I focus on software design, but my interests also lie in music, photoshop, and video editing.

I enjoy applying my skills and knowledge to new problems to create fun and interesting solutions. Computer Science has many diverse areas of application, and I strive to help discover new ways technology can help people, whether its with work, school, or just for a bit of fun. I love to create new things, and the infinite number of possibilities that can be brought to life by technology is an exciting challenge.
