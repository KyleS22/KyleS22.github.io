Java Checkers was a little project I put together in my spare time, due to my interest in computer networks.  I had been exposed to minimal amounts of networking code throughout some of my undergraduate classes, and I wanted to see if I could apply the concepts I had learned to something fun.  

The game works by using the local network to check for other users currently playing the game.  You can select a player to challenge, and then the games begin.  Game moves are sent back and forth between players as they complete their turns, until somebody wins.
